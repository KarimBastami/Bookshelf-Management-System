# MyReads - Bookshelf Management System
  This project was part of my graduation requirements for Udacity's React Course. This application is basically a book shelf management system. You are first presented
  with a main page with 3 bookshelves (Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read). Each bookshelf will by default contain the books stored in the online server setup for this
  course. There will also be a navigation button giving you access to a search page. Books you search for will be displayed and can be added + moved through the shelves in 
  the main page while also being updated on the server to maintain the same bookshelf even after refreshing the page.
